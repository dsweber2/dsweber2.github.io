There is far too much quality produced out there for me to name everything I
like. If you're somewhat crazy, here's [my feedly
opml](/feedly-2019-08-07.opml). Otherwise, a sample biased towards the better
sources:


# Mathematics, Statistics and ML
* [Statistical Modeling, Causual Inference, and Social
  Science](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/): See the name. Andrew
	  Gelman and friends.
* [The Endeavor](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/): generally short posts on
		computational math.
* [Computational Complexity](https://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/)
* [What's New](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/): Better math writing than most textbooks
* [Nuit Blanche](https://nuit-blanche.blogspot.com/) more of a collection of
		links than anything, but they're usually good.

		geometer who writes well on many topics
* [Distill](https://distill.pub/): surveys of the state of neural networks

		noise. Or at least the hype



# Less-wrong/Effective Altruism adjacent

* [Scholar's Stage](https://scholars-stage.blogspot.com/): A historians' view of
  China, behavioral science, and strategic thought
* [Gene Expression](https://www.gnxp.com/): Or Razib's writing in general. He's
  pretty insightful on world history and genetics.

  tech market

  immortal empress fighting an empire that is not quite what it seems.

  to do with and needs to survive.

* [Sword
  Interval](https://www.webtoons.com/en/fantasy/sword-interval/ep-1-prologue/viewer?title_no=486&episode_no=1):
  the supernatural is leaking into the world, and it is emphatically *not* friendly.

* [Seed](https://www.webtoons.com/en/sf/seed/prologue/viewer?title_no=1480&episode_no=1):
	Relatively fast AI take-off done well. So far.

  a common reference point.

* [Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal](https://www.smbc-comics.com/): It never
  ends. How does he do it?
