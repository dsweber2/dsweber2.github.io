        "excerpt":"When thinking about what the future, often we are drawn to trying toextrapolate from the past. One of the principle difficulties with doing this isthat exponential growth is difficult to really grok seriously. There’s a quotein the defense community1 that Quantity has a quality all of it’sown. Shoot one bullet a minute, and you’ve got a bunch of lines pointed ateach other firing. Shoot 500 bullets a minute and you’ve got trenchwarefare. The same is true elsewhere, so we should expect to see major qualitativechanges as we pass by various orders of magnitude. Over the past 10 years, a certain amount of growth has occurred. In the linearcase, we should expect to see the same amount of change happen in another 10years. But in the exponential case, 10 years of progress happens insignificantly less than 10 years. Supposing we have growth rate \\(r\\), and wewant to know how long until the future experiences what took us heretofore 10years to achieve. We can write this as\\begin{align}\tP(0) - P(-10) &amp;= P(t) - P(0)\\\\\tA_0 - A_0(1+r)^{-10} &amp;= A_0 (1+r)^{10 + t} - A_0(1+r)^{10}\\\\\t\\ldots\\\\\tt &amp;= \\textrm{log}_{1+r}\\big(2 - (1+r)^{-10}\\big)\\end{align} To be more concrete, supposing that we consider a growth rate of ;then we need only look 7.7 years in the future. \tTake a gander. 2015 is 3 years out, which doesn’t seem that drastic. On theother hand, to get as much growth as happened SINCE THE END OF WORLD WAR 1 weonly need to look out to about 22 years. If we assume the far less modest 7%,we plateau out at 11 years; in general, the asympote will be. For 3% this is 23.5 years and for 7% this is 10.2 years. It’sworth noting that this horizon is very sensitive to small differences inpercent near zero. So how to interpret this? Part of this is that we’re using an absolute measureof difference to measure a process that is fundamentally about multiplicativedifference. On the other hand, that there is a plateau at all does tell ussomething useful. To the degree that quantity makes quality, we quickly run outof a scope where anyone has ever seen this much growth. I would like to point out that this has actually been true for a large part ofthe last 200 something years, so it is not actually a new phenomina that thefuture is going to change more than anyone has ever experienced. While no onebefore has experienced this much growth, several generations now have thatexperience. It might explain some things How long until we’ve gained as much as we did in the past 10 years? Exponential growth, despite its ubiquity is surprisingly difficult to thinkabout.

Orso some disembodied voice coming from somewhere between 0 and 1 toldyou. Anyways, this frog is running along somewhere, hopping some fixed amountevery second. Let’s say you want to pay it a visit; to do so, you need to catch up to it at some point. We’ll assume that you have some super special bootsthat let you hop any distance on the line in a single step. Given that youdon’t have much to do on the integers, you set out to find it. What is astrategy that can guarantee that you find the frog at some point in yourinfinitely long life? Take a minute or two to think about a solution. Turns out the easiest way to think about this is instead to think about tryingto catch every frog on the integers, moving at every speed. We can thinkabout these frogs as equivalent to the integers ; corresponds to the frog that started at the point  moving with speed. Then all we need to do is design a path that visits every point in, though simply by cardinality there must exist some suchfunction. One such solution is a path that circles like in the following diagram ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Let’s consider a utilitarian value system with equal weights for all people, asingle resource with a fixed amount RRR, and the same utility function for allpeople. It is a relatively well known fact that people’s reported happinessscales with the logaritm of the wealth available to them. If we’re looking tomaximize total happiness based on the number of people that exist, we want tochoose NNN, the number of people, to maximize∑i=1NAlog⁡bRN=ANlog⁡bR−NAlog⁡bN  \\sum_{i=1}^N A\\log_b\\frac{R}{N} = AN\\log_b R - NA\\log_b Ni=1∑N​Alogb​NR​=ANlogb​R−NAlogb​Nwhich after some simple calculus is just N=bRN = bRN=bR. This implies that thereis some ideal number of people, rather than an arbitrary race to thebottom. Which makes sense; the part of the logarithm that is “doing work” inthis scenario is actually the part near the origin where a person’s utilitygoes to negative infinity when they have no resources. It’s worth asking ifthat end of the equation is actually correct On the other hand, we know that people are economically productive, and that wedon’t just have resources independent of the presence of people. The relevantquestion is how productive people are Relevance There’s a fundamental question of whether we actually live in such a world. Oneslight problem with the premises is that we don’t have finite resources, butthat the economy is growing in real monetary terms. Often the problem with thought experiments is that they sneak in rather massiveassumptions when you’re not looking.1 The repugnant conclusion doesn’t payattention to how distributing resources is a problem, or the fact that we cansend people off to other planets. One needs to be careful about the role of negatives People weigh losses more heavily than they weigh an objectively similar gain;the descriptive psychology of this is known as Cumulative prospecttheory. The actuallevel of resources that people get is both never equally distributed, orconstant, so a world just above the zero line, is also one where there aresignificantly many people who have crossed the threshold. someone seems to have thought of this             for example the chinese roomargument doesn’t specifyhow the people do the translation. I hope that the complexity of NLP(natural language processing) and the difficulty of creating GTP-2, whichonly vaguely passes this test, convinces you that most of the difficultylies in this part. &#8617;       ","categories": ["rationality","altruism"],

        "excerpt":"Principally, a place for me to scribble ideas, ideally in a way that isaccessible and useful to others. Generally, I’ll talk about Effective Altruismrelated topics, random bits of math and math puzzles, some data sciencequestions, possibly social science commentary from time to time. Metacalculus More intentionally, there’s a project on summarizing mathematical theories deepneural networks, best found via the tag dnn theory. Without further ado: Deep Neural networks: What do they know? Do they know stuff? Let’s find out! This is a broad subject which simultaneously has surprisingly old roots1 andstrikingly open questions. At the root of this is that the mathematicalstructures of deep neural networks are so simple: stochastic gradient descent(maybe with some memory), composition of very simple nonlinearities, and somelinear operators with some simple structures. This combination meansthat there are parallels to be made with many fields of mathematics. Not all ofthese end up telling us something useful, although knowing which is which is adifficult question. Roughly, you can expect this blog to give an opinionated and not always experttake on many papers on the subject, presented in a fairly random fashion. Thereare, however, summary pages that will give sub-abstract level summaries of theworks linking them together. Expect these pages (and this one) to change fairlyfrequently.   Approximation Theory  Learning Theory  Harmonic Analysis  Combinatorial  Tensor factorization  (Stochastic) differential equations  Matrix AnalysisOne thing you can expect this blog to not do is try to teach you how to dodeep learning. There are a billion and one resources out there already. Just goread distill if that’s what you’re interested in. (TODO: add a link to thatmedium article) What was known: an insultingly brief tour Most2 of the existing discussion before the current AI summer was focused onapproximation theory and learning theory. Broadly, approximation theoryapproaches a class of functions, asks, how well can you express thisfunction with these budget constraints? and tends to call it aday. Obviously that’s not quite enough, since we need to find that function,but it’s certainly a minimal requirement for an effective function class, andit allowed us to conclude that at least one hidden layer is necessary. Thereare some interesting modern results that get into examining the trade-offsbetween depth and width, which you can read more abouthere (think of that as a meta post which willupdate whenever I add a post in that series). Learning theory, on the other hand, is concerned with making sure . Ideally,these are the sorts of guarantees you want very broad theory to be able to giveyou. One problem: these bounds are. Where do we go now?             Hilbert’s thirteenthproblemfrom the turn of the 18^th century can actually be viewed as the sortof recursive nonlinearity that is at the heart of neural networks. As withmany things, the link is more tenuous than you might like: it tells us thatany multivariate function can actually be written as a two layernetwork where we get to choose the functions. &#8617;               there are other perspectives, such as the information geometry of neuralnetworks that were floating around at the time, but they weren’t the mostprominent or the ones that got passed on. &#8617;       ","categories": ["rationality","meta"],
