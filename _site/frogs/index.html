<p>Turns out the easiest way to think about this is instead to think about trying
to catch <em>every</em> frog on the integers, moving at <em>every</em> speed. We can think
about these frogs as equivalent to the integers <script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Z}^2</script>; <script type="math/tex">(i,j)</script>
corresponds to the frog that started at the point <script type="math/tex">i</script> moving with speed
<script type="math/tex">j</script>. Then all we need to do is design a path that visits every point in
<script type="math/tex">\mathbb{Z}^2</script>, though simply by cardinality there must exist some such
function. One such solution is a path that circles like in the following diagram</p>
