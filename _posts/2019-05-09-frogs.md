Suppose, for a second, that we live on the discrete integers. Kind of a weird
place to live, but whatever. And there's this frog who lives there with you. Or
so some disembodied voice coming from somewhere between 0 and 1 told
you. Anyways, this frog is running along somewhere, hopping some fixed amount
every second. Let's say you want to pay it a visit; to do so, you need to catch 
up to it at some point. We'll assume that you have some super special boots
that let you hop any distance on the line in a single step. Given that you
don't have much to do on the integers, you set out to find it. What is a
strategy that can guarantee that you find the frog at some point in your
infinitely long life? Take a minute or two to think about a solution.

Turns out the easiest way to think about this is instead to think about trying
to catch *every* frog on the integers, moving at *every* speed. We can think
about these frogs as equivalent to the integers $$\mathbb{Z}^2$$; $$(i,j)$$
corresponds to the frog that started at the point $$i$$ moving with speed
$$j$$. Then all we need to do is design a path that visits every point in
$$\mathbb{Z}^2$$, though simply by cardinality there must exist some such
function. One such solution is a path that circles like in the following diagram
