I am a graduate student at UC Davis working with professor [Naoki
Saito](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~saito/). My undergraduate was at UW
Madison, where I studied mathematics, computer science, and physics. My general
research interests at this point are
* Machine Learning
* Harmonic Analysis
* Optimization
* Mathematical Neuroscience

Currently, I am focused on understanding why Convolutional Neural Networks work
so well, specifically from the perspective of the scattering transform.
