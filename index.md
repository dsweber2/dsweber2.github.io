I am a graduate student at UC Davis working with professor [Naoki
Saito](https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~saito/). My undergraduate was at UW
Madison, where I studied mathematics, computer science, and physics. I grew up
in Rochester, Minnesota (effectively northern Iowa). My general research
interests at this point are
* Machine Learning
* Harmonic Analysis
* Optimization
* Mathematical Neuroscience

Currently, I am focused on applying formalizations of neural networks to a well
simulated sonar problem and understanding why that works, as well as a hefty
side interest in understanding why Convolutional Neural Networks work so well
in general.

Less formally, I try to think about [how we can best use our time to do
good](https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/
"Doing good is really hard. I make no claims to be doing anything particularly
extrodinary."), play board games (current favorite is hanabi), eat the
internet, and occasionally [write here](/blog/).
